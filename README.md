# BRIX-v0.9
A game mode script for Mafia 2 Online.

Script made by Bularthip. Special thanks to Rolandd and Mafia 2 Online/Multiplayer community.
In order to use this game mode you need Mafia 2 Online server files. Simply download these files into \resources\brix directory and use config.xml to load BRIX. Make sure you load .nut files under \client and \server with meta.xml.

Simply edit the settings on top of brix.nut as you like. If you know what you're doing you can edit the functions as much as you want.
